            <h2>Supporting local partnerships</h2>
            <p>
                Ending homelessness requires many people to work together across the voluntary sector, local government, health services and private sector. Homeless Hope have pioneered and continue to support local partnerships across England to improve collaboration.

        <h2>Working together to end homelessness</h2>
        <p>
            Over the last 10 years Homeless Hope has established trusting and long-lasting relationships and approaches with a range of statutory and non-statutory stakeholders across England which has given us a strong footing in bringing a range of different partners together to tackle local homelessness challenges. Our ability to convene organisations and individuals has paved the way for stronger partnership approaches to be developed and embedded across local areas and organically creates opportunities for linking up organisations to each other where appropriate, thus strengthening relationships across the sector.

          <p>So that people experiencing, or at risk of, homelessness are better supported by more cohesive local and regional organisations and systems, our Partnership Managers can help with:</p>
            <p>
                Our work encompasses a wide range of initiatives aimed at driving positive change and addressing key challenges. We specialize in forum development, creating charters, frameworks, and pathways that provide a foundation for progress. Our expertise includes operational protocol development and acting as a critical friend to support local strategy creation. We facilitate workshops, consultations, and stakeholder events to foster collaboration and innovation. Tailored 1-to-1 support is available to address specific needs, complemented by regional leadership events where senior leaders come together to identify and solve pressing issues. We champion coproduction with people who have lived experience, ensuring their voices shape outcomes. Our skill development and training programs focus on areas like systems leadership, while our conflict resolution services, such as mediation and relationship repair, bridge gaps between local authorities, voluntary sectors, and faith groups. Additionally, we support organizations in developing strong applications for the Homeless Winter Transformation Fund, aligning with best practice models and complementing local strategic responses.
